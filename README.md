# Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot - POE Part 2

## Overview

This is a console-based **Cybersecurity Chatbot** built using C# as part of a POE (Project of Evidence) for my Information Technology studies. The chatbot is designed to educate users on cybersecurity topics and promote safe online practices.

It offers a personalized, engaging experience through voice greetings, ASCII art, and a typing effect. The chatbot uses keyword detection, random fallback responses, and sentiment analysis to simulate meaningful conversations.
